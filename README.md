# MSc_EEC_script

This R script was developed during a masters thesis, focussing on the causes and consequences of variation in ornaments of a natural population of house sparrows. Using this code the heritability and selection of three ornaments were estimated and the plots drawn for presentation. 

The data required to run the analysis will be available upon publication.
