# MSc_EEC_script

This R script was developed during a masters thesis, focussing on the causes and consequences of ornament variation in a natural population of house sparrows. Using this code the heritability and selection of three ornaments were estimated and the plots drawn for presentation. 

The data required to run the analysis will not be made available until formal publication.
